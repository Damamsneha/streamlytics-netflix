# 📺 Streamlytics: The Data Behind the Binge

What if Netflix’s massive content library could spill its secrets?

Welcome to **Streamlytics** — where I take 7,000+ Netflix titles, clean them up, visualize the trends, and serve a hot plate of insights with Python. This is more than EDA — it's storytelling through data.

---

## 🔍 What I Explored
- 🆚 Movies vs TV Shows — who’s winning?
- 🌎 Which countries dominate the content game?
- 📆 How has Netflix’s content grown over time?
- 🧠 What themes show up most in descriptions?
- 🎭 Genre, ratings, and other juicy tidbits

---

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
- `Python` (the backbone)
- `Pandas` (for slicing & dicing)
- `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (for visual vibes)
- `WordCloud` (because aesthetics matter)

---

## 💡 Highlights & Wins
- Cleaned messy real-world data (yes, `NaN`, I'm looking at you)
- Handled datetime formats & missing values like a pro
- Delivered clean, minimal visualizations recruiters will actually *enjoy*
- Built a project that’s not just technical — it tells a story
